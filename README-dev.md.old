# README

**Roadmap**

* Add tests for "VAL"/"TYPE" (cf. README)
* Add tests for "dune run configuration"
  * Then test with "odoc" project
  * Then add libraries (runConfig starting build)
  * That is to make something flexible before using it for OCaml/...
* ~~Then work on the FileIndex and index files as modules~~
* ~~Test resolving documentation for FQN functions~~
* To work on resolve, you must first
  * Test the indexes and the resolve
  * Work on the possible elements that reference something
* Work on resolve
  * Try to resolve non-FQN functions from stdlib 
  * Implement "open" + modules resolutions (it's important)
  * Try to resolve non-FQN functions from context (e.g. walkback and add opens, then test "openname"+input)
* Add back the editor (doc+REPL actions)
* Add back the REPL
* Add auto completion for FQN
